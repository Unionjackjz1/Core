# Core

Core is a minecraft plugin created by Unionjackjz1.

This plugin will replace Essentials along with the following features

Include a Ban Management System
 -  Be able to see how many times a player has been muted/temp banned
 -  Staff are able to add notes on players

Be able to monitor your staff's commands
 -  Send a message to all people with core.notify when they run specific commands

Staff chat !
 -  Fully working staff chat plugin with mod/admin chat

Auto Broadcast!
 -  Be able to set up an auto broadcast time + order/randomize the broadcast

Anon Chat
 -  Staff will be able to talk to players with /anon without giving away their identity

Silly commands!
 -  Commands such as /slap and /firework will be given to donators as a fun silly thing to use on the server



And so much more!
-  I haven't quite thought of everything that will be added in this plugin, but I know that this is my main project and will keep growing!


Special thanks to Sketz and Simplicitee for helping me out with this project <33
